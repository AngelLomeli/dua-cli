DUA (-> Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of memory of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible.

### Tasks

* [ ] Simple CLI to list top-level directories similar to sn-sort
* [ ] A multi-threaded directory walker capable of being used for all kinds of directory-based computations.
       Ideally, each listing of a directory can be handled by a separate thread.
