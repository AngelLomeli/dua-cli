**dua** (-> _Disk Usage Analyzer_) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible.

### Installation

Via `cargo`, which can be obtained using [rustup][rustup]

```
cargo install dua-cli
```

### Usage

```bash
# count the space used in the current working directory
dua
# count the space used in all directories that are not hidden
dua *
# learn about additional functionality
dua aggregate --help
```

### Roadmap

#### ðŸš§v2.0 (_wip_) - interactive visualization of directory sizes with an option to queue their deletion

A sub-command bringing up a terminal user interface to allow drilling into directories, and clearing them out, all just using the keyboard.

##### Other Features

 * [ ] Single Unit Mode, see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bvjtan/introducing_dua_a_parallel_du_for_humans/epsroxg/)
 * [ ] Evaluate unit coloring

#### âœ…v1.0 (_released_) - aggregate directories, fast

Simple CLI to list top-level directories similar to sn-sort, but faster and more tailored to getting an idea of where most space is used.

### Development

#### Run tests

```bash
make journey-tests
```

#### Learn about other targets

```
make
```

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [jwalk][jwalk], all there was left to do is to write a command-line interface. As `jwalk` matures, **dua** should benefit instantly.
