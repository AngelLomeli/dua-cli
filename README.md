**dua** (-> _Disk Usage Analyzer_) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible.

### Installation

Via `cargo`, which can be obtained using [rustup][rustup]

```
cargo install dua-cli
```

### Usage

```bash
# count the space used in the current working directory
dua
# count the space used in all directories that are not hidden
dua *
# learn about additional functionality
dua aggregate --help
```

### Roadmap

#### ðŸš§v2.0 (_wip_) - interactive visualization of directory sizes with an option to queue their deletion

A sub-command bringing up a terminal user interface to allow drilling into directories, and clearing them out, all just using the keyboard.

##### Other Features

 * [x] Single Unit Mode, see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bvjtan/introducing_dua_a_parallel_du_for_humans/epsroxg/)
 * [ ] Evaluate unit coloring - can we highlight different units better, make them stick out?

#### âœ…v1.2 (_released_) - - the first usable, read-only interactive terminal user interface

That's that. We also use `tui-react`, something that makes it much more pleasant to handle the
application and GUI state.

#### âœ…v1.0 (_released_) - aggregate directories, fast

Simple CLI to list top-level directories similar to sn-sort, but faster and more tailored to getting an idea of where most space is used.

### Development

#### Run tests

```bash
make journey-tests
```

#### Learn about other targets

```
make
```

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [jwalk][jwalk], all there was left to do is to write a command-line interface. As `jwalk` matures, **dua** should benefit instantly.

### Limitations

* One cannot abort the filesystem traversal
 * as we are in raw terminal mode, signals will not be sent to us. As as we are single-threaded in
   the GUI, we can not listen to input events while traversing the filesystem. This can be solved,
   of course, and I would love the solution to use async :).
* In interactive mode, you will need about 60MB of memory for 1 million entries in the graph.
* In interactive mode, the maximum amount of files is limited to 2^32 - 1 (`u32::max_value() - 1`) entries.
  * One node is used as to 'virtual' root
  * The actual amount of nodes stored might be lower, as there might be more edges than nodes, which are also limited by a `u32` (I guess)
  * The limitation is imposed by the underlying [`petgraph`][petgraph] crate, which declares it as `unsafe` to use u64 for instance.
  * It's possibly *UB* when that limit is reached, however, it was never observed either.
* Dedication to `termion`
  * we use [`termion`][termion] exlusively, and even though [`tui`][tui] supports multiple backends, we only support its termion backend. _Reason_: `tui` is only used for parts of the program, and in all other parts `termion` is used for coloring the output. Thus we wouldn't support changing to a different backend anyway unless everything is done with TUI, which is really not what it is made for.
